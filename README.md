🏥 Groq-Based Medical Report Simplification & Clinical Text Analysis
Welcome to Groq-Based Medical Report Simplification & Clinical Text Analysis, an AI-powered healthcare NLP project that transforms complex medical reports into clear, patient-friendly explanations while performing intelligent clinical text analysis.

This system leverages Groq LLM inference, modern NLP pipelines, and interactive deployment to make medical information easier to understand for patients, students, and healthcare assistants. .

📌 Project Overview

Medical reports often contain technical jargon that is difficult for non-experts to understand. This project solves that problem by:

✅ Simplifying medical language into plain English ✅ Extracting key clinical insights ✅ Highlighting diagnoses, medications, and findings ✅ Generating patient-friendly summaries ✅ Enabling interactive AI-powered analysis

The goal is to bridge the communication gap between clinical documentation and patient comprehension.

🎯 Key Features

🧠 Medical Text Simplification – Converts complex clinical notes into simple explanations

📄 Report Summarization – Generates concise summaries of long reports

🏷 Entity Extraction – Identifies diseases, drugs, procedures, and lab terms

🤖 Groq LLM Integration – Ultra-fast inference for real-time processing

🌐 Interactive UI – User-friendly web interface for report analysis

🔒 Privacy-Friendly Design – Focused on safe handling of sensitive text

🎥 Demo

🧩 Workflow Explanation

Think of this system as a smart medical translator:

Upload or paste a medical report

The AI analyzes the clinical language

Key information is extracted

A simplified explanation is generated

A patient-friendly summary is returned
